== 0.3.0 / 20100507
* ZMQ::Socket#send and ZMQ::Socket#recv semantics changed
  * The official 0mq ruby bindings utilize strings for #send and #recv.
    However, to do so requires lots of copying to and from buffers which
    greatly impacts performance. These methods now return a ZMQ::Message
    object which can be subclassed to do lazy evaluation of the buffer.
    
  * Added ZMQ::Socket#send_string and ZMQ::Socket#recv_string. They
    automatically convert the messages to strings just like the official
    0mq ruby bindings.

  * Fixed bug in ZMQ::Util#error_string
  
  * Split the ZMQ::Message class into two classes. The base class called
    UnmanagedMessage requires manual memory management. The Message
    class (used by default by Socket) has a finalizer defined to
    automatically release memory when the message object gets garbage
    collected.
