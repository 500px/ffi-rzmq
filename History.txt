== 0.4.0 / 20100510
  * Changed the Socket#recv method signature to take an optional
  message object as its first argument. This allows the library
  user to allocate and pass in their own message object for the 
  purposes of zero-copy. Original behavior was for the library to
  *always* allocate a new message object to receive a message into.
  Hopefully this is the last change required.
  
  * Modified the Socket constructor to take an optional hash as its
  final argument. It honors two keys; :receiver_klass and
  :sender_klass. Passing in a new constant for either (or both) keys
  will override the class used by Socket for allocating new
  Message objects. 

== 0.3.1 / 20100509
  * Modified ZMQ::Message so we have both an UnmanagedMessage where
  memory management is manual via the #close method, and Message where
  memory management is automated via a finalizer method run during
  garbage collection.
  
  * Updated ZMQ::Message docs to make it clearer how to use a subclass
  and FFI::Struct to lazily access the message buffer. This gets us as
  close to zero-copy as possible for performance.
  
  * Fixed a memory leak in Message where the FFI::Struct backing the
  C struct was not being freed.
  
  * Tested the FFI code against MRI 1.8.x and 1.9.x. It works!
  
  * Patched a potential problem in LibZMQ::MessageDeallocator. It was
  crashing under MRI because it complained that FFI::Pointer did not
  have a free method. It now checks for :free before calling it. 
  Need to investigate this further because it never happened under
  JRuby.
  
  * Modified the Socket constructor slightly to allow for using
  unmanaged or managed messages.
  
  * Changed the /examples to print a throughput (msgs/s) number upon
  completion.

== 0.3.0 / 20100507
* ZMQ::Socket#send and ZMQ::Socket#recv semantics changed
  * The official 0mq ruby bindings utilize strings for #send and #recv.
    However, to do so requires lots of copying to and from buffers which
    greatly impacts performance. These methods now return a ZMQ::Message
    object which can be subclassed to do lazy evaluation of the buffer.
    
  * Added ZMQ::Socket#send_string and ZMQ::Socket#recv_string. They
    automatically convert the messages to strings just like the official
    0mq ruby bindings.

  * Fixed bug in ZMQ::Util#error_string
  
  * Split the ZMQ::Message class into two classes. The base class called
    UnmanagedMessage requires manual memory management. The Message
    class (used by default by Socket) has a finalizer defined to
    automatically release memory when the message object gets garbage
    collected.
